    center : numpy array

    Notes
    -----
    ARCH generates samples by choosing new directions from the sampling space's
    center and the warmup points. The implementation used here is the same
    as in the Matlab Cobra Toolbox [2]_ and uses only the initial warmup points
    to generate new directions and not any other previous iterates. This
    usually gives better mixing since the startup points are chosen to span
    the space in a wide manner. This also makes the generated sampling chain
    quasi-markovian since the center converges rapidly.

    Notes
    -----
    The sampler is very similar to artificial centering where each process
    samples its own chain. Initial points are chosen randomly from the warmup
    points followed by a linear transformation that pulls the points towards
    the a little bit towards the center of the sampling space.

    If the number of processes used is larger than one the requested
    number of samples is adjusted to the smallest multiple of the number of
    processes larger than the requested sample number. For instance, if you
    have 3 processes and request 8 samples you will receive 9.

def sample(model, n, method="optgp", processes=1, seed=None):
    """Samples valid flux distribution from a cobra model.

    The function samples valid flux distributions from a cobra model.
    Currently we support two methods:

    1. 'optgp' (default) which uses the OptGPSampler that supports parallel
        sampling [1]_. Requires large numbers of samples to be performant
        (n < 1000). For smaller samples 'arch' might be better suited.

    or

    2. 'arch' which uses artificial centering hit-and-run. This is a single
       process method with good convergence [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model from which to sample flux distributions.
    n : int
        The number of samples to obtain. When using 'optgp' this must be a
        multiple of `processes`, otherwise a larger number of samples will be
        returned.
    method : str, optional
        The sampling algorithm to use.
    processes : int, optional
        Only used for 'optgp'. The number of processes used to generate
        samples.
    seed : positive integer, optional
        The random number seed to be used. Initialized to current time stamp
        if None.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        The generated flux samples. Each row corresponds to a sample of the
        fluxes and the columns are the reactions.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently, cobrapy does not support the definition of complex constraints
    for a model. If you want to add additional constraints those have to be
    implemented in your model with mock reactions.
